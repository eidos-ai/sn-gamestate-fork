# SoccerNet Game State Challenge

Welcome to the SoccerNet Development Kit for the Game State task and Challenge.
This kit is meant as a help to get started working with the data and the proposed task.

The SoccerNet Game State Recognition task is a novel high level computer vision task that is specific to sports analytics.
It aims at recognizing the state of a sport game, i.e., identifying and localizing
all sports individuals (players, referees, ..) on the field based on a raw input videos. More information about the task and the dataset can be found on our [official website](https://www.soccer-net.org/tasks/new-game-state-reconstruction).


Participate in our upcoming Challenges during the [CVPR 2024 International Challenge at the CVSports Workshop](https://vap.aau.dk/cvsports/)! 
The participation deadline is fixed at the 30th of May 2024. 
The official rules and guidelines are available in [ChallengeRules.md](ChallengeRules.md).

### ⚽️ About the Game State Reconstruction Task
Game State Reconstruction can be seen as a compression task, where the goal is to extract high level information about a sport game given an input raw video.
The high level information to be extracted includes the following:
- The 2D position of all sports persons on the field
- Their role (player, goalkeeper, referee, other)
- For player and goalkeepers:
  - Their jersey number
  - Their team affiliation (i.e. left or right w.r.t. the camera viewpoint)

This high level information can be nicely displayed as a 2D minimap, or radar view, as shown in the GIF above.
Game State Reconstruction is a challenging task as it requires to solve several subtasks such as:
1. Pitch localization and camera calibration 
2. Person detection, re-identification and tracking 
3. Jersey number recognition 
4. Team affiliation

For more information, please have a look at our [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDeSdOR9Ing).

### 🏟️ About the Game State Reconstruction Baseline
For the purpose of this challenge, we use the [TrackLab framework](https://github.com/TrackingLaboratory/tracklab), an open-source modular tracking framework.
The [TrackLab repository](https://github.com/TrackingLaboratory/tracklab) contains all generic code related to multi-object tracking (object detection, re-identification, tracking algorithms, etc), whereas the [sn-gamestate repository](https://github.com/SoccerNet/sn-gamestate) contains the additional code specific to the SoccerNet Game State Reconstruction task (jersey number recognition, team affiliation, etc).
The diagram below represents the complete pipeline of the baseline.
TrackLab make it easy to add/customize/replace modules in the pipeline. 
This enables participants to focus on one or more specific subtask of the challenge, without worrying about other tasks.
We strongly encourage participants to analyse some videos to build a better intuition on which part of the pipeline should be improved.
We will provide more technical details about all components of the baseline in the near future.

## Quick Installation Guide
This guide will tell you how to install the framework, download the dataset and all models weights, and run the baseline on a single video from the validation set.
Tracklab will create a `.mp4` video showcasing the game state reconstruction results under `output/{date}/{time}/visualization/videos/021.mp4` in your current working directory.

### 1. Installing TrackLab and the GameState baseline 
Before running the baseline for the first time, you will need to clone the project and setup the environment as described below.

#### Clone the repositories
First git clone this repository, and the [TrackLab framework](https://github.com/TrackingLaboratory/tracklab) *in adjacent directories* : 
```bash
mkdir soccernet
cd soccernet
git clone https://github.com/SoccerNet/sn-gamestate.git
git clone https://github.com/TrackingLaboratory/tracklab.git
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using an IDE (like PyCharm or VS Code), we suggest creating a single project with `soccernet` as root directory.
> Instructions : [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-project-structure.html) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces)

#### Option 1: Install using Poetry
1. Install poetry : https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer
2. Install the dependencies : 
```bash
cd sn-gamestate
poetry install
poetry run mim install mmcv==2.0.1
poetry shell
```

To enter the virtual environment created by Poetry, you can either use `poetry shell`,
or prefix all commands by `poetry run`.

#### Option 2: Install using conda
1. Install conda : https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/
2. Create a new conda environment : 
```bash 
conda create -n tracklab pip python=3.10 pytorch==1.13.1 torchvision==0.14.1 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia -y
conda activate tracklab
```
3. Install all the dependencies with : 
```bash
cd sn-gamestate
pip install -e .
pip install -e ../tracklab
mim install mmcv==2.0.1
```

#### Updating
Please make sure to check the official GitHub regularly for updates.
To update this repository to its latest version, run `git pull` on both repositories:
```bash
git pull
git -C ../tracklab pull
```

After updating, you should rerun the installation of the dependencies in case they are updated 
(either running `poetry install` or *both* `pip install`'s).

We will advertise big updates on the [soccernet discord](https://discord.com/invite/cPbqf2mAwF).

### 2. Downloading the Dataset and the Baseline Models Weights
#### Automatic download
Tracklab will automatically download the SoccerNet-gamestate dataset and all models' weights when you run the baseline for the first time.
If the script stopped before the download was completed, please delete the dataset folder and start from scratch to avoid any error.
If you choose this option, you can go directly to the next step.

#### Manual downloading of SoccerNet-gamestate
If you want to download the dataset manually, you can run the following snippet
after installing the soccernet package (`pip install SoccerNet`) : 

```
from SoccerNet.Downloader import SoccerNetDownloader
mySoccerNetDownloader = SoccerNetDownloader(LocalDirectory="data/SoccerNetGS")
mySoccerNetDownloader.downloadDataTask(task="gamestate-2024",
                                       split=["train", "valid", "test", "challenge"])
```

After running this code, please unzip the folders, so that the data looks like : 
```
data/
   SoccerNetGS/
      train/
      valid/
      test/
      challenge/
```

You can unzip them with the following command line : 
```bash
cd data/SoccerNetGS
unzip gamestate-2024/train.zip -d train
unzip gamestate-2024/valid.zip -d valid
unzip gamestate-2024/test.zip -d test
unzip gamestate-2024/challenge.zip -d challenge
cd ../..
```

### 3. Running the baseline on a single video
#### Setup

> [!NOTE]
> Tracklab uses the [Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra) configuration library.

You will need to set up some variables before running the code in [soccernet.yaml](sn_gamestate/configs/soccernet.yaml) :
- `data_dir`: the directory where you will store the different datasets (must be an absolute path !). If you opted for the automatic download option, `data_dir` should already point to the correct location.
- All the parameters under the "Machine configuration" header. For the corresponding modules :
  - The `batch_size` (lower these values if you encounter memory issues)
  - You might want to change the model hyperparameters
 
#### Command Line
Finally, run the SoccerNet Game State Reconstruction baseline with the following command :
```bash
python -m tracklab.main -cn soccernet
```
By default, this command will perform game state reconstruction on one SoccerNet validation sequence, display results in a .mp4 video saved on disk and print the final performance metric.
As a reminder, the dataset and all model's weights will be downloaded automatically on the first run.

You can find all possible configuration groups at the top when running the following command :  
```bash
python -m tracklab.main --help
```

You can have a look at the default parameters in [soccernet.yaml](sn_gamestate/configs/soccernet.yaml).

## Tutorials

### How to get started

We invite users to read carefully the following resources:
1. [TrackLab README](https://github.com/TrackingLaboratory/tracklab/blob/main/README.md) for further instructions about the framework.
2. [soccernet.yaml](sn_gamestate/configs/soccernet.yaml) for more information about the available configurations.
3. [Hydra's tutorial](https://hydra.cc/docs/tutorials/intro/) to better understand how to configure TrackLab. 

### Adding a new module

If you want to add a new module in the tracklab pipeline, you can either add it in this repository,
by adding code in (a new directory in) [sn_gamestate](sn_gamestate) and configuration files in 
[sn_gamestate/configs/modules](sn_gamestate/configs/modules), which will be added automatically. 

If you would like to create a separate project that makes use of tracklab, you will need to declare
the location of your config file using an [entry point](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/entry_point.html#entry-points-for-plugins).
The entry point group should be `tracklab_plugin` and it should point to a class containing a variable called `config_package`,
as shown [here](sn_gamestate/config_finder.py), this variable should point to the location of your configuration folder.
Temporarily, you can also specify a directory using Hydra's `--config-dir`.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues after upgrading to the latest version, do not forget to run `poetry install`  or `pip install -e .` and `pip install -e ../tracklab` to keep your environment up to date.
Feel free to open a GitHub issue or contact us on Discord if you need further assistance.
